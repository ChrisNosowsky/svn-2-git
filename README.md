Welcome.

This is a custom test repository I made to see what it would take to convert from SVN to Git using:
1. Git Bash
2. svn-git utility

The process was fairly easy. I was able to convert the documents from SVN to Git with history being retained. Also retains all Branches, Tags, and Trunk. Please see the SVN to Git documentation on how this was done.
